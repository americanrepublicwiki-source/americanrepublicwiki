# TL:DR
The [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] needs to completely switch to [[Dictionary/Selfish Messaging|Selfish Messaging]] over [[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]] for all groups it wants to be members, majority or minority. 
# Claim
The [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] over the past several decades has prioritized [[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]] for large majority populations such as White Americans and Men. This has recently been exploited by the [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican Party]] and to a greater extent [[Orgs/MAGA/MAGA|MAGA]]. This is been a major messaging failure and the reasoning will be detailed below.
# Definitions
There are 2 messaging styles that this paper is going to walk through:
- [[Dictionary/Selfish Messaging|Selfish Messaging]]
- [[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]]

![[Dictionary/Selfish Messaging|Selfish Messaging]]

![[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]]

Additional ideas are described in [Modes_of_persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion). The argument set forth is the need to decompose `Pathos` into separate messaging styles [[Dictionary/Selfish Messaging|Selfish Messaging]] and [[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]].
# Why does this matter?
From 1981 to 2016, [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican Party]] exclusively appealed to white voters via [[Dictionary/Selfish Messaging|Selfish Messaging]], typically through fear of change and their environment worsening for them. From 2016 - 2025 [[Orgs/MAGA/MAGA|MAGA]] used this and additionally undermined the [[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]] used by the [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] to pull minority voters. Examples being:
- They will higher taxes on you!
- They will be brain washing your kids with X,Y,Z!
- You're children's children will be paying the debt!
- They are going to erode the family values you rely on!
Additionally, they undermined the [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|democrats]]'s [[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]]:
- Is the black community better off after [[People/Barack Obama/Barack Obama|Barack Obama]]? 
- Is it fair to you [Latin community] that illegals can just walk into America and take our jobs / healthcare / taxes / social programs?

It is important to note:
> Both the [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican Party]] and [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] know how to use [[Dictionary/Selfish Messaging|Selfish Messaging]], however they are very selective with the groups this applies to, and the [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] has been weakening on this front.

The [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] uses [[Dictionary/Empathetic Messaging|Empathetic Messaging]] messaging for trying to pull in white voters, and male voters. It uses [[Dictionary/Selfish Messaging|Selfish Messaging]] for the black community and LGBT community.
