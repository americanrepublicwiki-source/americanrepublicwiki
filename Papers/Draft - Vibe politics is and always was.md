There is, online, but also in real life, a feeling of [[Terms/Doomerism|Doomerism]] that has been festering in the American culture. This has become more pronounced with regard to the failures of public discourse over science and health communication, as well as foreign policy and economics. 

As partner in this [[Terms/Doomerism|Doomerism]], particularly facing the [[Orgs/Democratic Party/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], is the recent concept of [[Terms/Culture|Vibe Politics]]. The idea being that the average person, average voter, and particularly [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican]] voter has their political positions and opinions based solely off of vibes as opposed to facts, logic, or self-interest. 

> Note: Would be good to get examples of this.

This is a [[Terms/Doomerism|defeatist]] idea and a [[Terms/Red Herring|distraction]]. Those that push the idea that everything *now* is *just* vibes politics, ignores the fantastic ignorance of the average voter both in the [[Orgs/United States of America/United States of America|United States of America]] but also abroad. Not only was this present within that last hundred years, this has been known about since the [[Terms/Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. A reasonable mind would say that the [[Orgs/United States of America/United States of America|United States of America]] has never had a more knowledgable, educated populace than today.

However in 2026, we have the [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Trump Administration 2024|Trump Administration]], so how did we get here? My primary argument is this:

> [[Terms/Culture|Culture]] is the tool by which a society naturally gets a foolish, selfish people to do smart selfless things.

On other words, politics, in [[Terms/Liberalism|liberal]] society, has always had a predominantly vibes oriented voting population. The key difference during the time of the [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Trump Administration 2024|Trump Administration]] and previous century is that the [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican]] party, a now mostly [[Terms/illiberal|illiberal]] and [[Terms/Authoritarianism|Authoritarian]] friendly, has successfully accumulated enough of a cultural movement to dictate:
- American institutions are untrustworthy.
- Experts are untrustworthy.
- [[Terms/American Left|American Left]] is against self-improvement, health, private property.
- [[Terms/American Left|American Left]] hates [[Terms/American White Voting Demographic|white people]], [[Terms/American Christiananity|Christains]], Law enforcement, the military, and America's founding.
- People ideologically aligned with the party are used in-place of otherwise knowledgeable field experts.
- Illegal Immigrants is a problem that is affecting most Americans.
- Trans Athletes is a problem that is affecting most Americans.

The above ideas are pervasive, and pushed persistently by the likes of [[Fox News]], [[Orgs/Breitbart News Network/Breitbart News Network|Breitbart News Network]], [[Orgs/Info Wars/Info Wars|Info Wars]], and then echoed by [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican]] elected representatives. In addition to this there are large alternative education institutions such as [[Orgs/Discovery Institute/Discovery Institute|Discovery Institute]], private schooling, and [[Orgs/Home School Legal Defense Association/Home School Legal Defense Association|Home School Legal Defense Association]]. This was farther amplified by the likes of independent (at least initially) advocates such as [[People/Rush Limbaugh/Rush Limbaugh|Rush Limbaugh]], [[People/Ben Shapiro/Ben Shapiro|Ben Shapiro]], [[People/Jordan Peterson/Jordan Peterson|Jordan Peterson]], [[People/Charlie Kirk/Charlie Kirk|Charlie Kirk]], and [[People/Joe Rogan/Joe Rogan|Joe Rogan]].

This organizations covered large swaths of American culture that initially were not simply seen as political. Additionally many of these organizations and advocates had their own goals and opinions that they pushed daily. The primary strategy that the modern [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican]] party and Conservative movement in general appears to be "on the defensive".

The [[Terms/American Left|American Left]] has its own counter to this, however is smaller in scope, typically without a large overarching idea of what the [[Orgs/United States of America/United States of America|United States of America]]'s future should look like. There are news organizations such as [[Orgs/CNN/CNN|CNN]], [[Orgs/MSNBC/MSNBC|MSNBC]], [[Orgs/CBS/CBS|CBS]] (no longer left leaning), and [[Orgs/NBC/NBC|NBC]]. These organizations legitimately try to appear balanced in their coverage, taking neutral views of their coverage. Even though a reader who has seem them may disagree, compared to the apparatus constructed by the [[Terms/American Right|American Right]], these news organizations are essentially neutral. Prior to the [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Trump Administration 2024|Trump Administration]], this was not so obvious and a typically [[Terms/Liberalism|liberal]] would argue a leftist bias in their organizations. It is critical that *in comparison to the [[Terms/American Right|American Right]]'s media system* they are essentially neutral.

To illustrate this point, lets walk through various cases recently.

Boosted by the [[Terms/Covid-19 Pandemic|Covid-19 Pandemic]] the [[Terms/Anti Vax Movement|Anti Vax Movement]] successfully installed a [[Terms/Anti Vax Movement|vaccine skeptic]] [[People/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr|Robert F. Kennedy, Jr]] as a cabinet member in the [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Trump Administration 2024|2024 Trump Administration]] as head of the [[Orgs/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]. Over the course of a few months he and the administration [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Timelines/Tylenol causes autism announcement|announced that Tylenol definitely causes autism]] and proceeded to confidently advise clinicians to limit its use for pregnant women. This announcement are derided by the science community. This was later [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Timelines/Tylenol causes autism walkback|walked back]] to a much more nuanced position since at that point [[People/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr|Robert F. Kennedy, Jr]] acknowledged that the science linking [[Terms/Tylenol|acetaminophen]] with [[Terms/Autism|Autism]] is not strong.
