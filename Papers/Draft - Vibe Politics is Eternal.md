There is, online, but also in real life, a feeling of [[Terms/Doomerism|Doomerism]] that has been festering in the American culture. This has become more pronounced with regard to the failures of public discourse over science and health communication, as well as foreign policy and economics. 


To illustrate this point, we can walk through basic failures various cases recently.

Boosted by the [[Terms/Covid-19 Pandemic|Covid-19 Pandemic]] the [[Terms/Anti Vax Movement|Anti Vax Movement]] successfully installed a [[Terms/Anti Vax Movement|vaccine skeptic]] [[People/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr|Robert F. Kennedy, Jr]] as a cabinet member in the [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Trump Administration 2024|2024 Trump Administration]] as head of the [[Orgs/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]. Over the course of a few months he and the administration [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Timelines/Tylenol causes autism announcement|announced that Tylenol definitely causes autism]] and proceeded to confidently advise clinicians to limit its use for pregnant women. This announcement are derided by the science community. This was later [[Administrations/Trump Administration 2024/Timelines/Tylenol causes autism walkback|walked back]] to a much more nuanced position since at that point [[People/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr/Robert F. Kennedy, Jr|Robert F. Kennedy, Jr]] acknowledged that the science linking [[Terms/Tylenol|acetaminophen]] with [[Terms/Autism|Autism]] is not strong.
