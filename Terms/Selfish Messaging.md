Ever since the founding of the [[Orgs/United States of America/United States of America|United States of America]], its been acknowledged that men (women) are easily made jealous, envious, and fearful. It is important to recognize the reality that you can't simply ask people to reason their way to be more cooperative. Their needs and concerns must be addressed and made relevant. This can be made relevant in the positive such as "We will do this for you" and the negative "The other side is going to do X,Y,Z that will hurt you".

Negative:
- "This can happen to you!"
- "This effects you, your family, your friends!"
Positive:
- "You have X,Y,Z issue, and this is how we will help you."
