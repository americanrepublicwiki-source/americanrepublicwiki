# About the American Republic Wiki

>[!warning] This website and its contents is currently in flux. Each page has an edit me button at the top, however contributions will be rejected until the structure and content stablizes.

>[!warning] The copyright for now is a restrictive Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Once it stabilizes, it will transition to a more permissive license that just asks for attribution. Forks are allowed but must maintain any `Copyright (c) 2025 American Republic Wiki` notices and the `LICENSE.md` at the root.
