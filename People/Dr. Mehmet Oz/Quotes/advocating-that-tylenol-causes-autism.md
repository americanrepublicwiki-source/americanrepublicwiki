“As a physician, I have seen how devastating autism spectrum disorder can be for children and their families,” **CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said.** “Today’s actions represent an unprecedented, comprehensive approach to deepen our understanding of the causes of autism, share what we know and don’t know based on current research, and ensure that every child has a better chance to thrive. By providing access to a drug to treat symptoms associated with autism, we are providing hope to families and providers who have until today had very limited options.”
