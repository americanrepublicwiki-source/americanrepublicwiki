# About the American Republic Wiki

>[!warning] This website and its contents is currently in flux. Each page has an edit me button at the top, however contributions will be rejected until the structure and content stablizes.

>[!warning] The copyright for now is a restrictive Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Reference [[LICENSE.md]] for more info. This may change in the future, however it is less disruptive to start restrictive -> open up.

## Goals
Biggest argument against this is: "Why have a wiki when we have orgs like [[Orgs/Politifact/Politifact|Politifact]]?" Prior to [[Orgs/Trump Administration 2016/Trump Administration 2016|Trump Administration 2016]] that was enough since the news cycle typically stayed on a single topic with a few points for several weeks. Additionally, being perceived "neutral / unbiased" was a normal and desirable property of a news / fact checking org.

However, the 2025 political landscape has changed primarily due to the rhetoric promoted by [[Orgs/MAGA/MAGA|MAGA]] and a 6 decade restructuring of the [[Orgs/Republican Party/Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The amount of fake facts and statements is a daily occurrence. To combat this, [[Terms/Liberalism|liberal]] people, Conservatively or Socially [[Terms/Liberalism|liberal]], need a way to take true individual facts, and combine them into effective rhetoric. 

## Document Structure
Obsidian and Quartz supports useful Graphs API and linking.

`Terms`
- A dictionary of terms, generally single files and are intended to be embedded in larger topics. 
- If these don't have a grouping Folder then they can be dumped at the base of the `Terms`

`Orgs`
- Groups of multiple people. This can range from Parties, Advocacy Groups, Extremist Groups, all the way to whole nations from the past, fictional, or current. 
- These are complex notes of format: *[[Templates/Org Template/Org Name Template|Org Name/Org Name Template]] plus additional notes*

`Papers`
- Opinionated articles, however must have evidentiary backing supported by the other sections of the wiki.

`People`
- Historical, or current public figures. 
- These are complex notes of format: *[[Templates/Person Template/Person Name Template|Person Name/Person Name Template]] plus additional notes*
