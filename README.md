- Opinionated articles, however must have evidentiary backing supported by the other sections of the wiki.
`People`
- Historical, or current public figures. 
- These are complex notes of format: *[[Templates/Person Template/Person Name Template|Person Name/Person Name Template]] plus additional notes*
